Description:
The Wave Grid project is an interactive grid-based application developed using React.js. It features a 15x20 grid of squares, where each square displays a dynamic bouncing wave pattern. The waves and their colors change over time, providing a visually appealing effect. The pattern adjusts dynamically to any grid size, ensuring a responsive design that maintains its engaging visual appeal.
